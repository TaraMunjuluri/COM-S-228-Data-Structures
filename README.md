# COM-S-228-Data-Structures
This is an archive of my assignments from the course Computer Science 228 (Data structures) at Iowa State University in the Fall of 2020. This course covers an object-oriented approach to data structures and algorithms, with emphasis on data abstraction, inheritance and subtype polymorphism, and generics. Abstract data type specification and correctness. Collections including lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, maps, hash tables, and graphs. Big-O notation and algorithm analysis. Searching and sorting. Graph search and shortest path algorithms. Emphasis on object-oriented design, writing and documenting medium-sized programs. 
Note:
All assignments are listed in the index, sorted accordingly. The PDF (assignment specifications/instructions) given to me for each assignment, along with the JUnit tests I was given are contained in each directory accordingly.
- Workspace is an Eclipse workspace directory written in Eclipse
- All projects are written/run in Java 8
- All tests are written/run in JUnit 4
